### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, my work revolves around learning new technologies and refining best practices. My focus is on collaboration, innovation, and customer satisfaction, aiming to provide high-quality solutions to meet user and organizational needs.

In my current role as a Software Engineer II at LitX, I've played a pivotal role in modernizing the distribution of legal information through our secure virtual platform. I was responsible for leading the development of our first in-house app, introducing numerous unique tools that have since become indispensable for customer support and generating business insights. Additionally, I oversaw the creation of our AI chat feature, marking the company's first foray into AI technology. Lastly, I successfully implemented the Stripe API, developing a tool from scratch to support our subscription model, which consequently doubled our revenue to over $16k.

Before LitX, I co-created [Constellation](https://constellation-load-testing.github.io/), an open-source tool that simplified the deployment of geo-distributed load testing across all 26 AWS regions. I oversaw the development of the data-aggregator component, a critical part of our ELT pipeline capable of handling over 130 requests per second. Additionally, I designed an intuitive data visualizer for easier data interpretation from load tests and established a caching system that reduced data loss by 63%.
