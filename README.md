### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake.

I am a highly experienced and versatile senior software engineering professional offering expertise in leading and supporting teams, high-level strategic planning, and full-stack software engineering.
I have a passion for writing fast and efficient code that is built to last.

I recently built [Constellation](https://constellation-load-testing.github.io/), an open-source, serverless, framework that simplifies geographically distributed API load testing.
Constellation was built with React, Node.js, AWS, and Docker.
   
See the Constellation case study [here](https://constellation-load-testing.github.io/)
