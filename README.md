### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake.

I am a software developer with a sales background based in Houston, TX.
I have a passion for writing fast and effecient code that is built to last.

Most recently I built [Constellation](https://constellation-load-testing.github.io/), an open-source, serverless, framework that simplifies geographically distributed API load testing.
Constellation was built with React, Node.js, AWS, and Docker.
   
See the Constellation case study [here](https://constellation-load-testing.github.io/)
